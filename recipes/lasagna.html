<p>This lasagna recipe takes a little work, but it is so satisfying and filling that it's worth it!</p>

<p>Ingredients</p>
<ul>
    <li>1 pound (450g) ground beef</li>
    <li>1 onion, finely chopped</li>
    <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    <li>1 can (28 ounces) crushed tomatoes</li>
    <li>2 cans (6 ounces each) tomato paste</li>
    <li>2 cans (15 ounces each) tomato sauce</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons dried oregano</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon dried basil</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon salt (adjust to taste)</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes (optional, for a bit of heat)</li>
    <li>9 lasagna noodles, cooked al dente</li>
    <li>15 ounces ricotta cheese</li>
    <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
    <li>3 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
    <li>1 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    <li>Fresh basil or parsley for garnish</li>
</ul>

<p>Steps</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
        <li>In a large skillet or saucepan, brown the ground beef over medium heat. Drain excess fat.</li>
        <li>Add chopped onions and minced garlic, cooking until softened.</li>
        <li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, oregano, basil, salt, black pepper, and red pepper flakes. Simmer for about 15-20 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld.</li>
        <li>In a bowl, combine ricotta cheese with beaten egg. Mix well.</li>
        <li>Spread a thin layer of meat sauce on the bottom of a greased 9x13-inch baking dish</li>
        <li>Place three lasagna noodles over the sauce.</li>
        <li>Spread half of the ricotta mixture over the noodles, followed by a third of the mozzarella and Parmesan cheeses.</li>
        <li>Repeat the layers, ending with a final layer of meat sauce and a generous topping of mozzarella and Parmesan cheeses.</li>
        <li>Cover the dish with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove the foil and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes, or until the cheese is golden and bubbly.</li>
        <li>Allow the lasagna to rest for about 15 minutes before slicing. This helps the layers set.</li>
        <li>Garnish with fresh basil or parsley before serving.</li>
    </ol>
