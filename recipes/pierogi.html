    <ol>
        <li>Roll out the chilled dough on a floured surface until it's about 1/8 inch thick.</li>
        <li>Use a round cookie cutter or a glass to cut out circles from the dough.</li>
        <li>Place a spoonful of the potato and cheese filling in the center of each dough circle.</li>
        <li> Fold the dough over the filling to create a half-moon shape, and press the edges to seal.</li>
