<p>Steps</p>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl add flour, eggs, oil, salt, and 1 ½ cups of water. Mix well to form a dough, adding more water if needed.</li>
        <li>Knead the dough on a flat surface for about 4 to 5 minutes or until it becomes smooth and pliable.</li>
        <li>Cover the dough with plastic wrap and let it rest at room temperature for at least 30 minutes or up to 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Peel the potatoes and cut them into 2-inch cubes. Place them in a large pot of salted water and bring to a boil. Cook the potatoes for 15 minutes or until fork tender.</li>
        <li>While the potatoes are cooking, in a medium skillet over medium-low heat, cook the onions in 2 tablespoons butter until tender without browning.</li>
        <li>Once the potatoes are cooked, place them in a large bowl and mash them. Add onions, cheese, and remaining butter. Continue mashing until the potatoes become very smooth.</li>
        <li>Using half of the dough, roll it out ⅛" thick. Cut out circles of dough using a 3" cookie or biscuit cutter.</li>
        <li>Scoop 1 ½ tablespoons of filling and roll into a ball, place on the pierogi dough. Fold the dough over to form a semi-circle and pinch the edges closed. Place on a baking sheet. Repeat.</li>
        <li>Repeat the layers, ending with a final layer of meat sauce and a generous topping of mozzarella and Parmesan cheeses.</li>
        <li>Cover the dish with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove the foil and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes, or until the cheese is golden and bubbly.</li>
        <li>Allow the lasagna to rest for about 15 minutes before slicing. This helps the layers set.</li>
        <li>Garnish with fresh basil or parsley before serving.</li>
    </ol>
